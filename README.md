# Contributing to All Saints Hackathon 2025

Welcome to the All Saints Hackathon 2025! This guide explains how to submit your project idea and get your team repository set up.

## Submitting Your Project

To participate in the hackathon, your team needs to submit a project proposal by creating an issue in this repository. Once submitted, we'll create a dedicated repository for your team and grant your team members the appropriate permissions.

## How to Submit

### 1. Create a New Issue

Click on the "Issues" tab above and create a new issue using the project submission template (if available) or follow the format below.

### 2. Required Information

Your issue should include the following information:

#### **Project Title** (Required)

A clear, descriptive name for your project.

#### **Team Members** (Required)

List the GitHub usernames of all team members. This is essential so we can:

- Create a team in the organization
- Grant everyone access to your project repository

**Format:**

```markdown
Team: Team Name
- @username1
- @username2
- @username3
```

#### **Project Slug** (Optional)

A short, URL-friendly identifier for your repository (lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces).

- If not provided, we'll generate one from your project title
- Example: `awesome-ai-tool` or `data-dashboard`

#### **Project Description** (Recommended)

A brief description of what you plan to build. This helps us understand your project and can be useful for other participants.

### 3. Example Submission

```markdown
## Project Title
Smart Campus Navigator

## Team Members
Team: Hackathon Team
- @alice_codes
- @bob_developer
- @charlie_design

## Project Slug (Optional)
smart-campus-nav

## Project Description
A mobile-friendly web app that helps students navigate the campus, find available study spaces, and track campus events in real-time.

## Tech Stack (Optional)
- React Native
- Node.js
- MongoDB
```

## What Happens Next

Once you submit your issue:

1. **Review**: We'll review your submission to ensure all required information is provided
2. **Team Creation**: We'll create a team in the All Saints Hackathon organization with all listed members
3. **Repository Setup**: We'll create an empty repository with your project slug (or generated from your title)
4. **Permissions**: Your team will be granted write access to your project repository
5. **Notification**: You'll receive a comment on your issue with a link to your new repository

**Timeline**: Project repositories are typically created within 24 hours of submission during the hackathon.

## Guidelines

- **Verify usernames**: Double-check that all GitHub usernames are correct (they're case-sensitive!)
- **Unique project names**: Try to choose a unique project title and slug to avoid conflicts
- **Update your issue**: If you need to add team members or change information, update your original issue
